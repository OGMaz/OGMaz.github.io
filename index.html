      Happy 2 Years Anniversary

    <p class="final-message">
      Celebrating our anniversary would have been so much easier if distance weren‚Äôt an issue, but we‚Äôve never let that stop us before. And even though I'm as broke as one can be right now (Much like my girlfriend sometimes, my bank account's giving me the silent treatment right now), I wanted to make this day meaningful in a special way. So instead of buying something, I decided to create something just for you‚Äîsomething out of the box to make this year memorable at least. <br /><br />
      My original plan was to use the last of my money to get you flowers and plan a nice dinner, because what's an anniversary without flowers? But as much as I would happily spend every last penny on my princess, I also knew it wouldn't be a good idea if it meant going without food for the next two weeks. So, I was stuck‚Äîuntil I remembered a video I saw a while back about a guy who programmed a website to ask his girlfriend to be his Valentine‚Äôs. And I thought‚Ä¶ maybe that‚Äôs it. Now, baby, let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîI am no IT expert, but I do know me a little programming, and I figured this could be the perfect idea.<br /><br />
      Once the idea was there, all that was left was making it happen. For the past two weeks, I‚Äôve been working on this project nonstop. And because I‚Äôm a perfectionist when it comes to you üòè, I wanted every little detail to be just right, which, of course, meant even more time and effort. But honestly? Doing this for you made all the work feel like fun. I just hope you can see how much thought and love I‚Äôve put into this, even if I couldn‚Äôt get you a physical gift this year. You know, one of my biggest love languages is giving you things, and it really hurts that I couldn‚Äôt do that the way I wanted to. But I hope this shows you just how much you mean to me.<br /><br />
      <span class="bold">Yours, always</span>
